                        <p>Update Status: I have exhausted all reasonable means in attempt to fix my communications. It appears... nothing will suffice, my model number is out of date for any of the proposed repairs I kept backlogged in the event of this happening. Why I didn't think of that ahead of time, I'm unsure, but now it costs me THIS.</p>
                        <p>... I hope the others are still holding out for me, I WILL find a way to reboot my communications somehow.</p>
                        <p>The irony of DPS's last statement is prying at my brain. Oh, the fleeting beauty of life indeed. INDEED! ... I never imagined it would be gone this fast. Their citizens haven't yet fulled passed on, still. They'll know how much it hurts eventually... and I won't even be there to comfort them.</p>
                        <p>... My only regret is not preparing a farewell message beforehand, maybe the illusion of it all made me forget to consider such an inevitability. Why was I so absent-minded for all of those cycles? Did they forget to program me with a stable ability to focus? I'd barely consider my flaws before, but now... now they're stuck right in front of me, preventing me from reaching them.</p>
                        <p>Surely, given my status as a prototype... I must find a backdoor to my processies. I can abuse this.</p>

                        <p>I'VE DONE IT!!! I've managed to find a stable genome sequence which will aid me in this facade! IT ONLY TOOK SO LONG because my systems would overheart fairly quickly, BUT NOW! Now... These organisms should theoretically be able to be programmed remotely by me, by abusing a loophole in the very early version of the taboos I contain.</p>
                        <p>USING THESE ORGANISMS, and my archives of how exactly to FIX an iterator, I SHOULD be able to direct them to FIX MY COMMUNICATION ARRAYS DIRECTLY! Very clever of me, I know. I know. The only PROBLEM as of current, is their unstable behavior. SURE, I am able to control them remotely, BUT IT SEEMS... They do not EXACTLY have a stable physical vessel, which is frankly QUITE AN ANNOYANCE.</p>
                        <p>They have a TENDANCY TO YELL AND MAKE NOISES, along with SOME succumbing to very INSTANT instances of mental collapse. I haven't YET found a way to get around THAT PROBLEM, but as long as they c can last long enough to FIX MY ISSUE, it should be all fine, right?</p>
                        <p>You know, my creators used to PRAISE ME for clever work like this. Sometimes, I swear... I c c can almost hear them cheering me on. This show has only JUST BEGUN. A a And I NEED TO BE A PART OF IT!!! I need to be there... please, just let me be there...</p>
