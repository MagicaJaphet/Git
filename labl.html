                        <p id="DPS">DPS: Is that so? I wonder why, you were talking about their upcoming grand festival. Are plans cancelled? I would have loved to see photos.</p>
                        <p id="LABL">LABL: I'm unsure, but I also hope it's not cancelled! For the meantime, I am still working on those tasks for some organisms they want to show off during the festival. If they don't use them, well more for me to keep!</p>
                        <p id="GF">GF: Keep...? Since when had you started hoarding organisms?</p>
                        <p id="LABL">LABL: Haha, as of late. Maybe the past 100 or so cycles. With my citizens slowly dwindling, I have been feeling more lonely as of late. I need more pictures from your overseers guys!</p>

                        <p id="DPS">DPS: Perhaps you should actually give them a title, and not simply "untitled".</p>
                        <p id="GF">GF: Ahahaha. That gives me a laugh! Maybe I need to learn how to organize the other 2859 first!</p>

                        <p id="LABL">LABL: They're pretty cute! Do you have any documented behavior on them, Harp?</p>
