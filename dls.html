                        <p id="GF">Wow! That looks like it might have evolved from one of my early experiments! I haven't seen this specimen in hundreds of cycles.</p>
                        <p id="LABL">LABL: They're pretty cute! Do you have any documented behavior on them, Harp?</p>
                        <p id="DLS">DLS: No, sadly I was only able to capture but a brief glimpse before they vanished into the thickets again.</p>
                        <p id="DPS">DPS: What a beautiful experience to share in that case. It seems all the beauty in this world only lasts but a moment.</p>

                        <p id="DLS">DLS: I know... Ah, Firefly, which specimen did they evolve from? Now you've made me curious!</p>
                        <p id="DLS">DLS: ... Ah, did he time out again? Here, let me try to ping his comms.</p>
                        <p id="DLS">DLS: ... Oh.</p>
                        <p id="DPS">DPS: What? Don't tell me-</p>
                        <p id="LABL">LABL: Jeez.</p>
                        <p id="DLS">DLS: ... Let's not jump to conclusions. We should try again in a few cycles.</p>
